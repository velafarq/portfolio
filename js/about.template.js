const about_template = $(`<section class="about"><h2 class="about__title">About</h2><p class="about__body">
I was drawn to coding because of its huge scope for the imagination and similarities to music theory.  
After receiving a Bachelor's degree in Cello Performance in Boulder, CO,
I decided to broaden my career and immerse myself in learning full-stack development. 

</p>

<p class="about__body">
Born in Belgrade, Serbia and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, I love traveling around the world, 
learning about other cultures and connecting with interesting and creative people. My aim is to work in a collaborative team work 
environment and to 
interact with fellow team members in an inspirational and productive manner.
I strive to produce innovative code that is full of artistic energy.

</p>

<p class="about__body">When I'm not coding, I'm out discovering interesting places around the Twin Cities, playing the cello, 
listening to jazz, and training my Golden Retreiver, Charlie Parker.</p>
