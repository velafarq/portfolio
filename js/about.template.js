const about_template = $(`<p class="about__body">My love for coding developed through my lifelong commitment for music making. 
After receiving a degree in Music Performance in Boulder, CO,
I decided to broaden my career and immerse myself in learning full stack development. 
I was drawn to coding because of its huge scope for the imagination and similarities to creating music and how it can bring anyone together. 
I love spending hours in front of my code until I create something cool and beautiful. When I’m not coding, I’m playing with my dog, in my music studio, practicing Bach
or composing my next rock song, or I am questionably combining my Serbian and South African heritage in the
kitchen, whipping up a tasty storm. Born in Belgrade, Serbia and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, I love traveling around the world, learning about other cultures and connecting with interesting people.
